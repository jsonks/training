## Account basics
### Creating accounts
1. Search to make sure the patron does not already have an account.
2. If not, click **Patrons** in the top navigation bar.
3. Click **New patron** then choose the appropriate patron category.
4. Fill in the form. Required fields are **red**.
5. To finish, click **Save** at the top of the screen.

>***Reminders***
> - The more info you can get, the better — this helps identify duplicate accounts.
> - Overdues and notices are sent to the primary email address.
> - Username and password allow the patron access to their account at seknfind.org.
> - Users can change their passwords on their own via the OPAC.
> - Passwords can be reset, but not recovered by staff.

#### Additional fields and functionality
##### Messaging preferences

Setting up messaging preferences is strongly encouraged. This allows the patron to be notified of due dates and holds via text and/or email.


##### Patron images

Adding a photo to the account makes it easier to tell that the correct account is in use and helps reduce account duplication. Hover the placeholder, click **Add** then browse to the file on your computer to add the image.

- _File size limit: 100KB_
- _Recommended dimensions: 200x300 pixels_


##### Account integrations
###### Cloud Library

Add the patron’s Kansas library card number into the **Kansas library card number** additional attribute to link the two accounts. This allows the patron, via the OPAC, to see their Cloud Library checkouts and holds, and also check Cloud Library items out directly from the OPAC.





###### Hoopla

If the **primary email address** on the account matches the email address used to register with Hoopla, the patron is able to see how many checkouts they have left along with current checkouts in their account summary in the OPAC. They can also check out directly from Hoopla search results within the OPAC.



### Linking child to parent accounts
Linking children (guarantees) to a parent (guarantor) account allows the parent and staff to quickly see checkouts and fines of the relatives’ accounts. To create this link:

1. On the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">child</span> account, click **Add guarantor.**
2. Search for the parent account and click **Select.**
3. Set the **relationship**.
4. (Optional) Set the **Show xxx to guarantors** settings to **Yes** to enable visibility of child checkouts/fines to the parent account in the OPAC.

_Note: The child account controls what the parent sees via privacy settings in the OPAC._


### Deleting accounts
1. Search for the account to be deleted.
2. **Verify** you have the correct account.
_Check the upper left area of the patron account to quickly see identifiable information including:_
    - _Name_
    - _Card number_
    - _Address_
    - _Phone number_
    - _Email_
    - _Birth date_
    - _Current home library_
3. Click **More** then **Delete**.
4. Click **Yes, delete** to finalize the deletion.
