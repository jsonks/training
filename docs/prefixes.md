## Using Prefixes

### When to use these codes
- An item with an old (less than 14-digit) barcode is returned to a library other than its home library.
- An item is sent to another library without having a new barcode added.
- Pre-pending is broken.

### How to use these codes
An Iola book with a barcode of **12345** would need typed in as **343110000123456**

A Chanute book with the barcode of **678910** would need typed in as **34316000678910**.
