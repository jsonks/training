![alt text](assets/opac_search3.png)

This allows for a more refined search and offers different ways to browse the collection.

> #### Tips
> - *Don't use too many words* - if your title is really long, try searching with fewer words to get more results.
> - *Don't use too few words* - if your title is short, try adding the author's last name or actor's last name.
> - *Leave out digits* - if you're searching for a title with a number in it, either leave the number off or type out the word (i.e. Terminator Two instead of Terminator 2).
> - *Leave out punctuation* - if the search isn't pulling back with a hyphen or apostrophe, try replacing the punctuation with a space.
> - *Check your spelling* - the search engine can sometimes guess at a mispelled word, but accurate spelling is more likely to give the correct result.
