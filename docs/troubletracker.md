The trouble tracker was created to help keep track of communication between libraries regarding missing items.

Each item should be tracked on a separate sheet and maintained when steps are taken to retrieve an item.

Please include a copy of the completed trouble tracker when requesting follow-up on the situation from the SEKnFind Coordinator.

PDF copies of the tracker are available here:
