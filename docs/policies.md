This document is stored electronically on the SEKLS website under Services > SEKnFind > ‘For Staff’ > Policies ([https://sekls.org/services/seknfind](https://sekls.org/services/seknfind)).

 

In libraries with more than one staff member, please make sure all staff can locate and refer to this document at any given time.

In libraries with only one staff member, please make sure one or more board members can locate and refer to this document at any given time.


# Policy Violations

If a member library is found to be in violation of the policies prescribed within this document, or fails to uphold the agreed upon responsibilities of membership, the System Director and staff will develop a remediation plan and work with the member library to resolve outstanding issues.

Libraries that no longer wish to conform to the policies and responsibilities of membership can find information on withdrawal from SEKnFind in [policy 6.10](#heading=h.ttmxnk6u7sl4).


# 1. Patrons


## 1. One patron – one account



1. Policy statement

    Each patron will have only one account within the SEKnFind Consortium. No new account is to be created for existing patrons.

    The home library will be determined by the patron’s library of first registration.

    The patron may choose to change his home library at any time. This most commonly occurs when the patron moves, or the patron wants to pick up their holds at a different library by default.

    A new physical card may be issued for the existing patron account.

2. Exceptions


    1. Teacher cards - a separate account for teachers to use specifically to checkout classroom materials, typically for a longer amount of time
    2. Student cards - for schools and colleges, it is permissible to create a separate account in addition to the user’s existing account if issues on the existing account would impede with their ability to use the library for institutional purposes
    3. Minors in joint custody - in situations such as joint custody arrangements, it is permissible, but not required, for minors to have one card linked to each guardian separately.
3. Procedure

    Whenever a patron approaches a library for a new card, circulation staff will search the patron database and verify that an account does not already exist for said patron.


     


    If the patron is found, account information including address, phone, and email should be updated at the patron’s discretion. Home library may be updated at this time as well.


     


    If the patron has multiple accounts, they should be merged onto the patron record with the fullest and most up-to-date information. Merging duplicate accounts combines all checkouts, fines, holds, and histories under the chosen account. Merging cannot be reversed. Please make certain that the accounts belong to the same person before conducting a merge.


    Once merged, issues must be resolved to bring the account back into good standing. This includes resolving any long overdue materials, lost item charges, and restrictions including those imposed by fines in excess of $10.00.


 


    When resolving problems with an account, effort should be taken to give the patron the best possible experience, ideally resolving outstanding issues when they first approach so they may fully utilize your library’s services. To achieve this, the following resolutions are recommended:



1. _Overdue and lost materials_ – If a patron has lost or overdue materials from prior transactions at another library: offer to check them in and send them on to where they belong.
2. _Late fees_ – If the patron wishes to pay off charges owed to another library: collect the fines, mark them as paid, and depending on the amount, forward or retain the payment as dictated by [policy 2.3](#heading=h.f2re3659y8x1).
3. _Lost materials_ fees – If the patron wishes to pay for a lost item where money is due to another library: collect the money, mark the fee as paid, and forward the payment to the other library with details about the lost item in question.

 


## 2. Patron confidentiality



1. Policy statement

    Patron confidentiality is paramount at all times for patron and circulation records pertaining to identifiable individuals, whether the patron is your library’s patron or not. No details will be shared with any person other than the patron himself regarding address, age, materials checked out or ordered, fines owed, computer use, or any other information from the patron record. The same is true of circulation history on an item. Patrons must opt out of having their circulation history saved. Staff creating new accounts should notify patrons of this option. Patrons should be directed to the Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC) if they wish to opt-out. The patron makes this decision.

2. Procedures

    If patron information is requested by a member of the police force, no information is to be provided. Police should be informed that the administration of SEKnFind rests with the Southeast Kansas Library System (SEKLS), and police requests for information should be referred to the director of SEKLS, or if (s)he is not available, other SEKLS staff.


    For privacy options, see the [OPAC section of the manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a_DENS7n-zZE9VTq1FOQOSS_wVlM6VLnz28uVQlvM-g/edit#bookmark=id.16pminlj2lhc).

## 3. Patron self-registration



1. Policy statement

    Patrons may register online via the OPAC.


    Self-registered patrons are allowed 2 holds; checkouts are restricted until the account is verified.


    Self-registered accounts are automatically deleted after 14 days if the account is not verified and the patron category is not updated.



2. Procedures

    When a self-registered patron approaches the desk for the first time, patron information should be verified as correct. The patron category must be changed from Self-Registered to an appropriate category (Adult In, Juvenile Out, etc.) or the account will be deleted.


 


## 4. Best practices for creating patron accounts



1. Uploading patron images

    To aid in identification and security of patrons who may request cards at multiple locations, libraries may upload a picture of the patron to the appropriate section of the patron record. This is voluntary and if the patron refuses, a notice will be loaded into the record in place of a picture to denote that the patron has already been asked and declined the inclusion of an image to their account. Maximum dimensions: 200x300 pixels; Maximum file size: 100K

2. Complete names for distinguishing accounts

    When a non-duplicate patron with a similar name to an existing patron is identified, adding extra info in the name, middle name, nickname and/or other name fields to both accounts to make distinctions can help avoid checkout errors and bad merges. 

3. Username and password

    Set a username and password for the patron at the time the account is created to allow patrons access to their account via the OPAC. Patrons can and should change their password upon first login to reduce security risks. Libraries may choose to follow a set scheme for both credentials, or let the patron choose. Usernames must be unique. Passwords must be at least 3 characters in length. 

4. Linking parent and child accounts

    Child accounts may be linked to parent/guarantor accounts during account creation. This allows staff to see information from the linked accounts in the patron record. When logged into the public catalog under the child account, privacy settings can be adjusted to allow the linked parent to view various information such as checkouts and fines while logged in under their own account.

5. Electronic resource integration
    1. _Hoopla_ - Hoopla authenticates against the SEKnFind patron database, meaning an account must be in good standing to utilize the service. Matching the email used to register for Hoopla to the primary email address on the patron account unlocks integrated Hoopla features when logged into the OPAC.
    2. _CloudLibrary_ - CloudLibrary authenticates using the Kansas State Library Card. Adding their state library card number to the appropriate field on the patron account unlocks integrated CloudLibrary features when logged into the OPAC.
6. Interlibrary loan patrons

    Interlibrary loan patrons are a means to keep track of items that have been sent to libraries outside of SEKnFind. When lending an item to fill a SHAREit request, checking the item out to an ILL patron will make it unavailable in the shared catalog and generate statistical tracking.



## 5. Maintenance responsibilities


### A. Patron cleanup



1. Policy statement

    Accounts expire every 12 months to give opportunity to update information at the time of renewal. A notice appears on the account 30 days prior to expiration and an email is sent 5 days prior to expiration for accounts with valid email addresses. Accounts that do not get renewed are considered ‘expired’.


    Patron accounts that have been expired for greater than 3 years and have no outstanding checkouts, holds, fees, or linked accounts should be deleted annually.


    Outstanding issues, activity and fees must be resolved before becoming eligible for deletion. Responsibility for patron account cleanup falls to the library of each individual transaction where checkouts and fees are concerned.


    Time limitations on debt collection fall to local policy.



2. Procedure

    Each library should run the [patron pruning report](https://staff.seknfind.org/cgi-bin/koha/reports/guided_reports.pl?reports=2483&phase=Run%20this%20report) at least once annually to identify patrons eligible for deletion. Batch deletion may be requested by sending the results of the report to the SEKnFind coordinator.



3. Frequency

    Maintenance on patron accounts should occur at least once a year.


# 2. Circulation


## 1. System-wide circulation and fine settings



1. Policy statement

    Circulation and fine rules are constrained by system-wide settings.


    Settings:

    1. Maximum amount a patron can owe before checkouts and holds are blocked: $10.00
    2. Maximum fine amount per patron: $9999.99
    3. Maximum number of holds a patron can place: 150
    4. Long overdue status is added to checked out items at 99 days overdue
    5. Circulation is based on the rules of where the patron is standing at the time of checkout
    6. Transferred materials circulate by the rules of the receiving library, not the owning library
    7. Renewal periods begin on the date the renewal takes place, not the date the item is due


## 2. Local circulation and fine settings



1. Policy statement

    Local circulation rules further constrain circulation and fine behavior to conform to local policy for each individual library, and may be limited to patron type and or item type. Note that rules _must_ be established prior to implementing a new item type to cause alternate circulation behavior.


    Commonly used local settings:

    1. Number of checkouts allowed
    2. Length of loan period (in days or hours)
    3. Fine amount, if any
    4. Fine grace period, if any
    5. Number of renewals
    6. Renewal period (can be longer or shorter than the regular loan period)
    7. Number of holds (limits holds within the system-wide 150 hold maximum)
    8. Overdue fines cap (halts fines at a specified dollar amount)
    9. Cap fine at replacement price

    A full list of options available in the [Circulation and Fine Rules documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17o3gviY_WvWiR2ChbBjK-gPgDJ1-1LSnri0yi2-FxwQ/edit?usp=sharing).


 


## 3. Collection of late fees and other charges



1. Policy Statement

    Staff at any library should collect late fees and charges owed at any other library when the patron is present and wishes to pay or must pay to reactivate his privileges. Charges must be below $10.00 for patrons to check out items.

2. Procedures
    1. If the collected late fee is more than $10, forward the collected money to the library it is owed.
    2. If the collected late fee is less than $10, forward the collected money or keep it at your library, depending on local policy.
    3. If money is collected for a lost item, always forward the collected money to the owning library.

 


## 4. Renewal of items abroad



1. Policy Statement

    When a patron asks to renew an item that is eligible for renewal but that was checked out at a different library, it is acceptable to renew the item for that patron. If the renewal requires an override of the renewal limit, contact the transacting library for approval before proceeding with the override.


 


## 5. Return of items abroad



1. Policy Statement

    Items returned at a location different from the location at which they were initially checked out should be checked in and moved forward.



2. Procedures

    Check in each item, follow any prompts that Koha displays (print, transfer and confirm a hold; return to a location; etc.).


    In the event that a barcode is old/too short, refer to the [Barcode Pre-appending Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ugDPCWQoXzf5X8wdEgpcoRs5vebzvRMxD9UO5Wq28WI/edit?usp=sharing).


 


## 6. New item sharing



1. Policy Statement

    SEKLS strongly encourages libraries to adhere to the best practice of letting the system work; that is, of sending materials to fill holds as soon as the request comes up on the library’s holds queue.


     


    A series of ‘New’ item types maintains the flow of sharing while giving members a choice of immediate or delayed sharing of new materials.


     


    Materials are considered ‘new’ for six weeks based on the date they are added to the catalog.


     


    Libraries who share new items immediately face no restrictions. Staff and patrons at these libraries may place holds on new items as soon as they are cataloged.


     


    Libraries who delay sharing of new materials for a six-week period face barriers to borrowing ‘new’ items to account for non-lending of ‘new’ items. Library staff and patrons at these libraries cannot place holds on the ‘new’ materials of other libraries. If you choose to delay sharing, you must contact the SEKnFind Coordinator for setup.


    As new item sharing is built upon reciprocity, libraries must regularly add new items to their collection to maintain the ability to borrow new items freely. Libraries who do not add new items in accordance with the participation agreement annually may be demoted to delayed new item sharing until a balance is restored. Evaluation is based on prior years’ performance. A waiver to this rule may be obtained under special circumstances and at the discretion of the System Director.


    Please note: Local holds prioritization is active for all libraries. Regardless of your ‘new’ sharing setup, your items will give priority to your patrons’ holds.

 



2. Exceptions
    1. It is permissible for immediate sharing libraries to place new items out for browsing prior to filling holds for no more than five days.
    2. Local patrons may be prioritized for local new items regardless of holds – if the patron brings an item to the desk that has a hold on it for another library, check the item out to the patron in front of you and fill the hold when the item is returned if necessary.
    3. All libraries may refuse to fill holds on their new items which have been requested for display purposes.
3. Procedures
    1. All libraries will use the appropriate ‘New’ item type on each new item added to the catalog.
    2. All materials marked ‘New’ will automatically update to a corresponding item type six weeks after addition to the catalog.
    3. All items past the six-week mark will be shared freely.

 


## 7. Best practices for circulation



1. Scanning

    Scan the barcode then look: the web-based system is dependent on your Internet speed and is often slower than you expect.



2. Checkout slips

    A checkout slip listing due dates and other information may be printed by clicking _Print_ then _Print slip_, or by clicking _Check out_ when no barcode is present in the checkout field.


    Checkout slips can present privacy concerns based on how much information is displayed on the slip. Each library may customize their slips individually; contact the SEKnFind coordinator for assistance on setup and modification.



## 8. Maintenance responsibilities


### A. Unreturned item cleanup



1. Policy statement

    Items that are not expected to be returned by a patron should be charged off to the patron account as a lost item fee. This removes the item from the account and frees it up to be deleted and/or replaced.


    When the item being charged off is owned by another library, the lending library should be reimbursed by the borrowing library at the point of charge-off to reduce the need for backtracking if and when the patron pays the fee.


    Items should be charged off no later than 180 days overdue.


    SEKLS staff is available to assist with cleanup and bulk remediation for libraries with large amounts of unresolved issues.



2. Procedure


    1. Pull up the patron account
    2. Click the barcode of the item in question
    3. Choose an appropriate status (Damaged and charged / Lost and charged)

    [Additional documentation is available in the training manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kypYylxi9GYCUyD9yFhLvQsXW-DPXE3dufCfhkoA2fQ/edit#bookmark=id.wt6hcbdthes4).




3. Frequency

    This process should be conducted regularly, at least once a month.


# 3. Holds & Transfers


## 1. Placing holds



1. Policy statement

    Record-level (Next Available) holds are to be utilized in nearly every situation.


    Item-specific holds lock requests to only one item which causes the hold to be filled slower and increases the potential for a hold to be abandoned. These should be used only in special cases.


     


    Item-specific holds are disabled in the OPAC.


 


## 2. Pulling holds



1. Policy statement

    Each library should pull holds at least once each day the library is open. It is permissible that holds be pulled only on days that a library receives courier, as long as the pulls are done prior to the courier’s arrival those days.


    The holds queue rebuilds every 15 minutes.


    Please note: Local holds prioritization revolves around the holds queue – items which are placed on hold and checked in prior to the rebuild will still favor the first hold, rather than the first local hold.


     


    Items that cannot be found must be marked missing. If your item is the only one on the record, the library of the requesting patron must be notified.


    Every item being sent to fill a hold must have a 14-digit barcode.


## 3. Best practices for holds & transfers



1. Item condition

    Per national interlibrary loan standards: “Borrowed items should be returned in the condition in which they were received at the requesting library. In particular, a requesting library should never affix adhesive labels or tape directly to any borrowed item.”



2. Lost and damaged item reimbursement

    When resolving issues where an item is lost or damaged by the patron of another library, it is recommended that the borrowing library charge the patron account and reimburse the lending library sooner than later, so that the lending library can seek replacement and to reduce the amount of backtracking and legwork should the patron provide payment at a later date.


    If the patron is ready and willing to pay for the item in question, it is allowable for them to write a check directly to the lending library to reduce additional paperwork.



3. Responsibility for replacement

    As soon as an item departs a lending library, it becomes the responsibility of the borrowing library. If the item never arrives at the borrowing library, or never finds its way back to the lending library, the borrowing library is responsible for replacing the item either via reimbursement or [material replacement claim](https://www.sekls.org/material-replacement/). Claims must be submitted within one year of the due date.



## 4. Maintenance responsibilities


### A. Holds awaiting pickup



1. Policy statement

    Holds not picked up by the patron within seven days of arrival at your library should be moved on. A small degree of flexibility is allowed in scenarios where it is known the patron will arrive after the 7th day.



2. Procedure


    1. Run the [Holds awaiting pickup](https://staff.seknfind.org/cgi-bin/koha/circ/waitingreserves.pl) report
    2. Compare the items on the _Holds waiting over 7 days _to your physical hold shelf
    3. Cancel any holds over 7 days via the report
    4. Check each item in and follow onscreen prompts

    [Additional documentation is available in the training manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kypYylxi9GYCUyD9yFhLvQsXW-DPXE3dufCfhkoA2fQ/edit#bookmark=id.2fjs2hqdpgvq).




3. Frequency

    This process should take place at least once a week.


### B. Items lost in transit



1. Policy statement

    Items lost in transit to and from your library must be investigated and accounted for.



2. Procedure


    1. Find problems using the transfers-to-receive report weekly
    2. Check your shelves for the item
    3. If not found, have the borrowing/lending/owning library check their shelves
    4. Determine responsibility for replacing the item
    5. Request reimbursement or request to be billed by the owning library

    [Additional documentation is available in the training manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kypYylxi9GYCUyD9yFhLvQsXW-DPXE3dufCfhkoA2fQ/edit#bookmark=id.foislmku1j3h).




3. Frequency

    These issues should be addressed at least once a week.

 


# 4. Cataloging


## 1. Support



1. Policy statement

    All cataloging-related issues should be directed to the SEKLS cataloging staff.


    Cataloging staff are available to perform specialty cataloging tasks such as original records that are not owned by other libraries.


    Due to the complexities of quality cataloging and the requirement to keep the database as clean as possible, each individual staff member needing to assist with cataloging must first complete training administered by SEKLS. Each cataloging staff member must log in under their own account.


    Additional policies and practices concerning cataloging within the SEKnFind consortium can be found in the[ online cataloging manual](http://sekls.org/services/cataloging/manual).

 


# 5. Reports


## 1. Custom reports



1. Policy statement

    No one aside from SEKLS staff may add new reports.


    Many custom reports are available in the reports module of Koha. For help locating a report, or to have a new report written, contact the SEKnFind coordinator.


    Unused reports are periodically removed. Should a necessary report be deleted, contact the SEKnFind coordinator to have it restored.

 


## 2. Statistical reports



1. Policy statement

    Basic statistical reports are available under the ‘Quick statistics’ portion of the reports home page. These are quickly accessible for monthly reporting purposes.


    SEKLS shall provide end-of-year statistics as they relate to the state statistical survey at the beginning of each calendar year.

 

 


# 6. Administration


## 1. Staff permissions



1. Policy statement

    For smaller libraries (one or two staff members), SEKLS will set up staff permissions. In these cases, please notify the SEKnFind coordinator of personnel changes so that permissions can be removed and assigned as necessary.


    For larger libraries, the library director or person designated by the director will set up staff permissions. We ask directors to observe the following limitations:



    * No one but the director or the person designated by the director shall be able to set permissions for staff. 
    * No one shall be given superlibrarian status.
    * No system preferences shall be changed.
    * The “edit_catalogue” permission shall only be granted after SEKLS staff has administered cataloging training.

    A detailed listing of permissions is available in the [Permissions Administration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kcyNgeaF8Nqz_Oy_8bxzAnG-eT8AezM7EE9w396OD4s/edit?usp=sharing) documentation.



## 2. Calendar setup



1. Policy statement

    Each library will define its own calendar of closings each year.


    Proper and timely calendar setup ensures that:



    1. Fines will not accrue on days the library is closed.
    2. The holds queue will not generate on days the library is closed.
    3. Items will not come due on days the library is closed.

 


## 3. Overdue notice setup



1. Policy statement

    Each library will write and define triggers for their own overdue notices. Up to three notices can be created per library. Overdue notices have the ability to restrict patron accounts when sent.

 


## 4. Purchase suggestion management



1. Policy statement

    Each library will manage its own purchase suggestions at least once a week.

 


## 5. Tag/comment moderation



1. Policy statement

    Tags and comments will be moderated by SEKLS staff.

 


## 6. Patrons pending modification



1. Policy statement

    Patrons are able to request modifications to their account information via the OPAC. Staff at the home library of the patron requesting modification will approve or deny the changes.

 


## 7. Posting news items



1. Policy statement

    Only the director or designated staff persons will be allowed to post news items; this requires a special permission setting.


    Primary use of the news tool is to append information to the bottom of date due slips. 


    News items of local interest may be posted at _your library_ on the OPAC, staff client, or both. This might include storytimes, book discussion groups, and other events aimed at your library’s individual community.


    Postings of general interest may be displayed at _all libraries _on the OPAC, staff client, or both. Annual book sales, Kansas Humanities Council speakers, author appearances, or other non-recurring events that may have a wider appeal beyond your community can be posted to _all libraries_.


     


    SEKLS staff will monitor news posts and adjust where they display if the audience is deemed inappropriate.

 


## 8. Director transitions



1. Policy statement

     In the event of a director’s departure from a library, certain standards must be maintained.


     


    _Staff Permissions_ - Representatives from the affected library should notify SEKLS staff immediately of any changes in directorship so that SEKnFind permissions may be adjusted. If the person(s) maintaining operation of the library in the interim does not have staff access, a circulation or substitute account for that particular library should be utilized.


     


    _Participation_ - During transitional periods where the director position is vacant, member libraries are expected to maintain a minimum level of participation in the consortium. Activities that must be performed daily, with or without a director include:



    * Checking out items
    * Renewing items
    * Checking in items
    * Collecting fines (if applicable)
    * Placing holds for patrons
    * Pulling the holds queue
    * Preparing items for courier pickup
    * Opening packages from courier delivery
    * Notifying patrons of waiting holds
    * Checking library email
    * Notifying patrons of overdue items

     


    In regards to cataloging, if remaining staff have not had cataloging training from SEKLS, items needing cataloged during the transitional period should be sent via courier to the SEKLS offices to be cataloged until the new director is hired and trained.


     


    _Closings_ - It is preferred that the library remain operational while director vacancies are being filled. If the library must close in the interim, SEKLS staff <span style="text-decoration:underline;">must</span> be notified so that consortial activity for the library may be suspended.



## 9. Library closings



1. Policy statement

    In the event of a temporary library closing due to emergency, maintenance, renovation, etc. all member libraries must be notified and steps must be taken to suspend SEKnFind participation to ensure service at other member libraries is unaffected.



2. Procedures

    Considerations must be made for the extent of a closure, both in regards to level of services being offered and length. In general, major steps include notifying the group, notifying courier management, and setting the library as closed on the Koha calendar.


    Further situational guidance is available in the [Considerations for Closings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16UTVJNxjE4xEkSGHsRrpemjqSN-HmNM0L9jb7lpxkTg/edit?usp=sharing) documentation.


    If a library is not in a position to complete these steps, contact SEKLS as soon as possible for assistance.
