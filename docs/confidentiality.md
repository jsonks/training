### Confidentiality statement

Records of patron registration and circulation which pertain to identifiable individuals shall be
regarded as confidential. As permitted by K.S.A. 45-221 (a) (23), they are deemed to be not
subject to disclosure under the Kansas Open Records Act. As the administrative authority for the
SEKnFind service, SEKLS is the agency to whom such a subpoena, warrant or order should be
submitted. No library participating in SEKnFind is authorized to disclose confidential records,
but should refer all requests to SEKLS. Such records shall not be released except pursuant to a
valid subpoena, warrant or court order in a court of competent jurisdiction. SEKLS shall have the
right to object to a subpoena and ask it be quashed on a case by case basis as allowed by law.
